## Introduction to the project 

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 (Secondary School) in England were unable to sit their examinations and instead were given predicted results by their teachers. These predicted GCSE results were then moderated by an algorithm based on their school’s past performance and grade distribution. Chaos and disappointment ensued on results day when many students felt that they were disadvantaged by the algorithm.  

In this research paper we aim to explore how accurately a school’s performance can be predicted based on its characteristics and if life-changing examination results can really be left to an algorithm.
